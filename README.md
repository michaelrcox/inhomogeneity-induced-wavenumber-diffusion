Supporting materials for paper titled inhomogeneity-induced wavenumber diffusion

1. ray tracing
- ray_tracing_for_github.ipynb contains ray tracing code for rotating shallow water system
- non-dimensionalisation in code is different to the one used in the paper
-  in particular, Bu and Ro in the code are not the actual Burger and Rossby number
-   if the ray tracing code is to be used, it is recommended that the ray tracing equations are rewritten to conform with the paper non-dimensionalisation

2. rotating shallow water flow
- flow.mat example rotating shallow water flow
- to be uploaded

3. geostrophic energy spectrum from 3D Boussinesq simulation
